These HTML, Javascript, and CSS files essentially display a data table where you can see information like names, ages, countries, and buttons to delete rows and change the color of the alternating rows. 


Something important to note: For me to send my work I needed to send my CSS files in .txt format because it would not let me send it. So for my HW5.txt file, you can convert it to a .css file and it all should work perfectly fine.
